Anaemia is the most common nutritional problem among women and is particularly rampant among pregnant women (Admad, Saeld, & Leila, 2018).",

It is a shortage in the size or number of red blood cells (RBCs) or the quantity of Hb they contain (Mahan, Ecott-Stump & Raymond, 2014). Haemoglobin is a substance in the blood that carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body.",

Iron forms an indispensable constituent of the Hb molecule, and nutritional anaemia results from insufficient intake of iron, protein, vitamin B12, folic acid, pyridoxine, ascorbic acid, and copper (Mahan, Escott-Stump & Raymond, 2014).",

                paragraph1: "Midwifery is a skilled, knowledgeable, and compassionate care for childbearing women, newborn infants, and families across the continuum from pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, birth, postpartum, and early weeks of life. The evidence shows us that midwifery plays a ‘’vital’’ role and, when provided by educated, trained, regulated, and licensed midwives, is associated with improved quality of care and rapid and sustained reductions in maternal and newborn mortality. Midwives are one of the largest groups of health workers who provide a wide range of health services, including promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitation, and supportive care to individuals, families, and groups (WHO 2016). The sustainability of midwifery depends largely on maintaining an equilibrium between those who enter and exit the profession. A multidimensional perspective about career choice has to be examined in order to situate the choice of midwifery as a career among adolescents. Adolescence is a stage/phase of life with an array of complex physical and socio-emotional states or a developmental phase that came about due to social changes (Heing 210, p4). Career is a blueprint of one’s life (Latif, Aziz, & Ahmed, 2016), where steps once taken forward cannot be retreated easily; therefore, it is the utmost critical choice one makes in a lifetime.",

Men are conscious of these cultural barriers in the community and this may explain why most of the women reported that their spouses have never participated in any ANC services and the lack of interest on their part to ask their partners to accompany them for ANC services. (Engender Health,2018).It was discovered that younger women were more likely to encourage male partner involvement in antenatal care compared to older women. The reason could we that the younger women were likely to experience anxiety and fear during pregnancy than older women who might have experienced pregnancy several times.

Childbirth is perceived by many as a natural process that would occur with little or no assistance. This perception informs the choices people make regarding the place of delivery. However, the childbirth process could be complicated and necessitate assistance for safe delivery. Moreover, a better outcome could only be anticipated if it occurs within a facility.
